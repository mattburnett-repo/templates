# Templates

Templates are stored in different branches. Look in the branches drop-down (upper left).

To clone a specific branch:
```
git clone -b <branchname> https://github.com/mattburnett-repo/templates.git
```

DO NOT CREATE A PR AND MERGE IT. THERE IS NO REASON TO DO SO.  
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT TEMPLATE FILES IN A BRANCH AND THEN COMMIT TO THAT BRANCH.  

IF YOU SEE A MESSAGE ABOUT COMPARE AND PR, GET RID OF IT BY  
- CLICKING ON THE CREATE PR BUTTON, THEN
- SCROLL DOWN AND CLOSE PR
